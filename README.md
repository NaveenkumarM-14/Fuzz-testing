# Fuzz-testing
This project implements a fuzz testing framework designed to automatically test applications for unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities by generating and injecting large volumes of random, malformed, or edge-case inputs.
# Benefits
1.Detects and mitigates vulnerabilities early in the SDLC

2.Reduces security debt and downstream costs

3.Enables DevSecOps practices through automation

4.Helps teams shift security testing left with minimal disruption

5.Enhances microservices resilience against real-world threats
